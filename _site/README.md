I am a first year PhD student at the University of Utah [Kahlert School of Computing](https://www.cs.utah.edu/). I am a member of [UtahNLP](https://nlp.cs.utah.edu/), where I am advised by [Prof. Ana Marasović](https://www.anamarasovic.com/). I primarily study where and why AI models diverge from human behavior, and how to use these differences to understand the underlying mechanisms of how models reason better. I explore this problem through the development of **benchmarks** which test models performance on reasoning tasks compared to humans, and through **interpretability methods**, to translate model behavior into insights that people can understand.

Outside of research, I spend most of my time rock climbing, running and skiing in the mountains around Salt Lake City. You can check out what I'm up to in climbing on [8a](https://www.8a.nu/user/alex-gill), and running on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/93133541).
